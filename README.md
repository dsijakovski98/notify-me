## Notify-Me - web app for notifications on local services
   
 Notify-Me is a web app made as part of my college course in Software Development and Testing. Made entirely in React, this app enables users to subscribe to companies that offer (electricity, plumbing or Internet) services in their communities. It is a kind of central hub for all the news that these companies post, as well as a place where users can be notified of potential service shortages in their cities, so that they can be informed and prepare for any inconveniences in time.
